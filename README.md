## 🎯 About The Game
**Connect 4 Master** is a classic strategy game I created during my high school preparatory year in 2022. The game features a vertical grid where players take turns dropping colored discs from the top. The objective is simple yet challenging: be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four discs of your color.

> *"Plan your moves, block your opponent, and connect four to win!"*

## 📋 How to Play

### Rules:
1. **Two players** take turns dropping colored discs into the grid
2. **Player 1** uses red discs, **Player 2** uses blue discs
3. **First player** to connect four of their discs horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins
4. If the grid fills completely with no winner, the game ends in a **draw**

Consider these strategies to improve your game:
<ul>
<li>Control the center columns when possible - they offer more connecting possibilities</li>
<li>Block your opponent when they have three in a row</li>
<li>Try to create multiple threats simultaneously</li>
<li>Look several moves ahead - anticipate your opponent's strategy</li>
</ul>
